My name is Suzanne Ruran Lut, a proud Malaysian national. I am an enthusiastic individual with a strong drive for personal and professional growth. My career goals and aspirations are centered around continuous learning, acquiring new skills, and making a positive impact in my chosen field.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I am pursuing my studies at UiTM Merbok Kedah, where I am enrolled in Diploma in Library Management. This educational journey has provided me with a solid foundation of knowledge and equipped me with essential skills that are relevant to my desired career path. Through a dynamic and engaging curriculum, I have gained insights into various aspects of information management. Additionally, my time at UiTM Merbok Kedah has allowed me to engage in academic discussions, collaborate with fellow students, and participate in various extracurricular activities, further enriching my overall learning experience.
</p>
<p>
Before embarking on my current academic pursuit, I completed my primary education at SK Temenggong Datuk Muip, where I had the opportunity to develop a strong educational foundation. Later, I attended SMK Riam Taman Tunku for my secondary education, where I not only excelled academically but also actively participated in various co-curricular activities, such as archery and diving.
</p>
<p>
Complementing my academic endeavors, I had the privilege of undertaking an internship at Pustaka Negeri Sarawak in Miri. This invaluable experience allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practice by applying the knowledge and skills gained in the classroom to real-world situations. During my internship, I actively contributed to promote the services provided by the library, collaborating with a diverse team of professionals. Through this opportunity, I developed strong interpersonal and problem-solving skills, while also gaining a deeper understanding of the library field and its practical applications.
